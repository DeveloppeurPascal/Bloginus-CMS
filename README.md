# Bloginus CMS

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Bloginus is a lightweight CMS for building functional sites on “low-end” servers. Including the default theme and a demo bootstrap theme, it takes up less than 2MB of disk space. All you need is PHP on your hosting.

You can use Bloginus on free hosting (Start10M) offered with any domain name at OVH without any problem.

Bloginus doesn't require a database. Content (pages, articles, sections) is stored as files in a simple tree structure: each section corresponds to a new folder in its parent. Posts are files in the folder of the section to which they belong.

You can upgrade your Bloginus installation with a system of plugins.

Customization, APIs and operation are detailed on the Bloginus website.
